# The JavaScript quiz!

## Description.
In this project, I worked to create a quiz, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This application allow the users to test their basic knowledge of Javascript with a simple quiz. 
Also allow them to compare their scores.

## Installation
The user just need to navigate to the this link: https://morcosta.github.io/Code-quiz/

## Usage
Once on the page, the user can click on the Start Quiz button. By doing so, the quiz will start, activating a count down timer of thirty seconds, and showing a question
with multiple choices. The quiz will display the word "correct"or "incorrect" based on the answer the user picked. For every wrong answer, 10 seconds will be detracted by
the timer. The game ends when the user answered all the questions, or when the timer reaches 0.
Once the game is over, the users can leave their initials, and these will be displayed with their scores on another page. The users will also have the option to clear the highscore.
